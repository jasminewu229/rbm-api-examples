# RCS Business Messaging API

This library provides a Java implementation for calling the Google RCS 
Business Messages API. and is used by the RBM Helper Library.

Usually you will not need to work with this library directly. 

The code has been generated using the
[Google APIS Client Generator](https://github.com/google/apis-client-generator).

## Maven usage

If you need to build a Java application that uses this library
directly then we recommend you use the latest version available
in the Maven repositories. Add the following to you `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.rbm</groupId>
  <artifactId>rcsbusinessmessaging</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

(Update for the latest version).

## Local usage

You can build and install a local version with:

```
mvn install
```
